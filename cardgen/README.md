# Random card generator

This library generates a random collection of cards for a game of set by randomly picking 3 out of 6 possible values for each attribute.
3 of the 6 values are always the default value available in regular set.

## Card attributes

### Shapes
- Triangle
- Pill
- Squiggle
- ?
- ?
- ?

### Number
The number of objects on a card can vary from 1 to 6.

### Colours


### Filling
- Hollow

- Dashed (horizontal)
- Dotted
- Wavy

## PNG vs SVG

An ambitious goal would be to use SVG image data so that the cards can be scaled for any resolution.
